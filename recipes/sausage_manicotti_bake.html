    <h3>How to Make Sausage Manicotti Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Sausage Manicotti:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill each pasta shell with half of a sausage link and arrange in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Pour Alfredo sauce evenly over pasta shells. Place a half of a string cheese on top, between each pasta piece. Top evenly with marinara. Add 2/3 cup water to the marinara jar and shake well. Pour water around the edges of the dish. Top with shredded mozzarella and Parmesan. Cover with foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until golden around the edges and bubbly all over, about 1 hour, uncovering during the last 25 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
