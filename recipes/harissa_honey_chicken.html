    <h3>How to Make Harissa Honey Chicken Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Harissa Honey Chicken:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Stir harissa paste, honey, olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Rub the mixture over each chicken thigh and under the skin, ensuring each thigh is coated evenly. Place chicken thighs skin-side up in a baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is browned and caramelized, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with green onions.</li>
    </ol>
