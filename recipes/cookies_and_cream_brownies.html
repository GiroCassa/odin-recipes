    <h3>How to Make Cookies and Cream Brownies Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Cookies and Cream Brownies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Mix sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Whisk butter, eggs, and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Add butter mixture to the flour mixture and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth out with a spatula. Add 16 Oreo cookies in an even layer (4 rows of 4 cookies), then spread the remaining 1/2 of the batter on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are brown and center is set, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Remove pan from the oven and set on a wire rack. Let brownies cool completely, at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>Crush 12 of the remaining Oreo cookies. Place whipped topping in a bowl and fold in crushed cookies; spread mixture over the top of the brownies. Crush the remaining 4 cookies; sprinkle over the top of the whipped cream mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 8: </strong>Keep refrigerated until you are ready to slice and serve.</li>
